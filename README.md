# Fire-Fighting-robot-using-Arduino
The Fire Fighting Robot is an autonomous system designed to detect and extinguish fires using flame sensors, a motor driver, a relay module, and an Arduino Nano. When a fire is detected, the robot moves towards it and activates a water pump or extinguisher to suppress the flames. The system is designed for quick response in hazardous environments, reducing the risk of human injury.
ðŸš€ Features
**Fire Detection**: Uses multiple flame sensors to identify fire sources.
**Autonomous Navigation**: Motor driver enables the robot to move toward detected fires.
**Fire Suppression**: Relay module controls a water pump or extinguisher for fire extinguishing.
**Obstacle Avoidance**: Ensures smooth movement towards the fire.
**Compact & Efficient**: Uses Arduino Nano for precise control and lightweight design.
